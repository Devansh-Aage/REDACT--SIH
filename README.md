# REDACTRONIX

REDACTRONIX is a secure, AI-driven redaction tool for customizable data masking and anonymization. It uses NLP models to identify and redact sensitive information across multiple formats while preserving document structure. With blockchain-backed audit trails, decentralized storage, and Role-Based Access Control, REDACTRONIX ensures privacy and compliance for industries like healthcare, legal, and finance.


## Achievement
REDACTRONIX achieved a top 6 position among over 100 teams working on the same problem statement at the Smart India Hackathon-2024. Our software stood out for its innovative approach to secure, AI-driven data redaction and privacy, providing an effective solution to the hackathonâ€™s challenge.
## Features

- AI-Powered Entity Recognition: Utilizes a RoBERTa-based NLP model to detect and redact sensitive information accurately.
- Multi-Format Support: Compatible with various document formats, ensuring redactions preserve document layout and integrity.
- Blockchain-Backed Audit Trails: Tracks and logs all redaction activities, ensuring transparency and traceability with blockchain.
- Decentralized Storage: Uses IPFS via Pinata for secure, decentralized file storage, enhancing privacy.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Manages user permissions with roles for organization admins, employees, and regular users.
- End-to-End Encryption for Data at Rest and in Transit: Ensures files are protected with AES-256 encryption both when stored and during transmission, providing robust security for sensitive data throughout the redaction workflow.
